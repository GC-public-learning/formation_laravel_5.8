# Scopeand mass assignement

the goal 

1) create a scope method in the customer model class to retrieve filtred data from the db
2) use the array returned by the request validate method to directly insert date in the new created object (in the method store())
- $customer = new Customer() and $customer->save() replaced by Customer::create($array);
- dont forget to add the status apart because it can be managed with the validate method (param of a check box exist or not)
3) modify the customer model to accept the new array
- protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'status'];
